   - Real-time updates are synchronized across all connected users.
   - Changes made by one user are immediately reflected for others.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

4. **Data Validation**:
   - Form inputs are validated in real-time to ensure data consistency.
   - Custom error messages for invalid or incomplete fields.

5. **State Management**:
   - Efficiently manages form data using state and context APIs.
   - Provides seamless user experience across navigation.

6. **Modern Stack**:
   - Built with **Next.js** for server-side rendering and optimized performance.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
